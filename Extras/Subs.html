            <h1>What are Subs?</h1>
            <h2>Subs is a monthly subscription through <a href="https://patreon.com/user?u=50582964">Patreon</a> and gives members Discord related benefits as well as monthly downloads. There are three different tiers of access, each gaining more features that stack on top of the previous. The list of features and commands will be shown below.</h2>
            <h1>What do the Members help cover?</h1>
            <h2>Members help cover the cost of the Wiki as well as the IPs for Java, Bedrock, and <a href="http://map.someminegame.com/#">Bluemap.</a> If we don't have any Members, we'll have to resort to ads on the wiki. A list of our amazing Members helping us stay ad-free can be found <a href="./Members">here</a>!</h2>
            <h1>What are the benefits to becoming a patron of the Legacy Of Lexicus?</h1>
            <h2>As mentioned above, you'll get special Premium bot access depending on your tier. The higher the tier, the more features you'll get! Note, these features are Discord only - and they will never interfere or interact with the Minecraft server to keep it free from the influence of <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pay-to-win.htm">P2W</a>. You'll also get your Discord username displayed separately from everyone else with no or different tiers with a tier specific shade of green, and on the Wiki page of all our patrons! (For Discord to work, you'll have to link your patreon and Discord accounts together)</h2>
            <div class="extrainfo">
                <h1>Sub $10 patrons will also have a monthly meeting with the server owner and other Sub $10 patrons. These meetings will include possible changes to the server, for instance commands, premium perks, and mods.</h1>
