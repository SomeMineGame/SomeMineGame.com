        <h1>The SMG-SMP Has Shutdown</h1>
        <p>Hello, this story is coming directly from SomeMineGame. Unfortunately, as the title says, the SMG-SMP has shut down at 8:39PM on November 1, 2023. The decision was made after the past couple month's performance. I was starting to have hope mid October as a couple players have joined outside myself. However, a vanilla server currently dubbed <a href="https://someminegame.com/Friends/Home">Average Server</a> was started which is vanilla but still crossplay. The little bit of traffic was killed as a result and I doubt it will heal again. What this means for me is that I'm paying for an unsed server to run, it's using extra power and resources, and storage.<br><br>This server has meant a lot to me over the course of this past year and a half it's been running. It started out as a vanilla server between me and some friends. Soon we added datapacks, then crossplay abilities, and eventually plugins. I also started making a python Discord bot as a new Python programmer. The server had taught me so much and has had a bunch of history in it. I learned to build better, heavily increased my programming skills, launched a website, and so much more. There was of course all of the fun. Wars were everywhere. The oldest was caused by me, but lead to VideoGamer579 and jjhlego getting into a rivalery.<br><br>This led to a government system being formed. This included a court room and more importantly a prison. Here, VG spent some days and an incorrect worldspawn led new players to spawn in it too, trapping them. VG and jjhlego had a fight in the prison which led to court fights, inventories and chests to be deleted, and players to develop new areas. I made a redstone powerplant that worked only if coal was provided. We flattened an entire large island together. We built communities together. We fought together. We learned together. We grew together.<br><br>We made memories together.<br><br>Whether building, fighting, terraforming. Having fun, getting annoyed, dying. Traveling, making stories, spending the nights together. We made memories together. I learned a lot and improved a lot. While I knew when I started this server it would eventually get shut down, I didn't realize how big an affect it would have on me.<br><br>I am thankful for everything that has happened here. The memories, the experiences, the growth in game and in my future career. It means a lot to me. Thank you for playing on this server with me. Never again will I have a server this great.<br><br>Signing off this server's newspage and server for the almost guaranteed last time,<br>SomeMineGame</p>
