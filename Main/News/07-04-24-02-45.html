        <h1>The SMG-SMP Is Off To A Great Start</h1>
        <p>The SMG-SMP is rapidly growing, even in its infant stages. SomeMineGame's channel has already gained 13 subscribers and over 1,000 views in just half a week. The streams are consitant in viewership, and have brought new players everyday. There has seemed to be decent interest in the server's unique plugin and datapack choices, as well as the Discord economy feature.<br><br>The SMG-SMP was first booted on July 1st, 2024 and has seen growth in the playerbase, viewerbase, and the server's structure. In the next few days and weeks, SomeMineGame is hoping to get the server's government in place to get that aspect going as well. The server's systems and roleplay will help the government system feel like an important part of the server and should hopefully give players a goal to work towards.<br><br>SomeMineGame really appreciates the support and enjoys interacting with the viewers in stream as this is a 2 year project finally being made public. He really enjoys that it has been received and welcomed happily by the members of YouTube. He hopes that by adding members of the public, there will be more fun and more cooperation. He hopes this server becomes a fun hub full of players having fun in a way never before seen on a Minecraft server that is also streamed every step of the way.<br><br>SomeMineGame plans to keep this server purely roleplay, with no scripted content. He believes this will keep the server full of fresh and genuine gameplay and excitement for everyone involved, whether in stream or in game.<br><br>Here's to the official public release of the SMG-SMP!!!</p>
