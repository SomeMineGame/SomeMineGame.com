        <h1>Server Reset</h1>
        <p>After one year of operating, the SMG-SMP will undergo a full server reset. This includes all Minecraft and Discord data. The change is due to the change in the player base and features over time. At first, the SMG-SMP was a simple vanilla survival server on a 3rd party hosting site. Then, they installed spigot to it for Bedrock access. Slowly more and more plugins and datapacks were added. After about 3 months, SomeMineGame began work on the Discord bot, which has grown very much since its start. Some players were also joining after a lot of this progress and didn't have very much compared to the top players. This reset is in hopes of providing everyone a similar start, at around the same time.<br><br>There has been an attempted reset in the past, but it didn't go as planned. The server's economy absolutely dominated it at the start, making late game items accessible by the end of the first day. Along with other problems, this server wasn't really enjoyable and didn't see many players. That's why after a month, the server was reverted back to the one we know and use.<br><br>So within the next week, we'll see how this new server rolls out. The economy will be mostly shut down at the start so that players have time to actually play the game while waiting for the economy to slowly build up in the background.<br><br>If you want to join the server, please fill out the following form!<br><a href="https://forms.gle/jHP6ZPvkoHavBxNTA">Server Access Form</a></p>
