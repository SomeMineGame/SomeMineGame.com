        <h1>SMG-SMP Possible Shutdown</h1>
        <p>Ever since the last 2 or 3 weeks of the last server, and the revival of the classic server, the server has seen a major decrease in players. What used to have at least 3-5 players a day slowly turned to 0-1 a week. The bots have also seen the lowest commands run in this period with dozens of commands ran a day to just a few a week. SomeMineGame is making a difficult decision currently on what to do in the future of the server.<br><br>SomeMineGame previously mentioned just over a month ago in Discord, "I don't know why, but I feel like someday, someday soon I'll host my last server. Start it for the last time. Have the final player, myself leave with it. Have nothing left as evidence besides a dead Discord server. Maybe this feeling is from the already decreasing player count and increasing hostility." while listening to a piece of music that really gets the memories and thoughts coming out. He didn't realize that this could be any truer so soon.<br><br>In a post on Discord, SomeMineGame mentioned that if the current trends in players stays around 0, he'll do another look at the circumstance at the start of November. If this happens, the server (Discord and Minecraft), wiki, map, and bots may all go down - permanently. Should the server manage to stay afloat, no action will be taken.<br><br>If you want the server to stay running, then join it a few times to help preserve it. If you're feeling generous, maybe even go <a href="https://someminegame.com/Main/Subs">here</a> to help fund it. This would take a lot of financal pressure off SomeMineGame and you'll even get access to premium bot features (along with giving SomeMineGame a reason to continue added features to the premium bot). This is the last month we have to potentially save the SMG-SMP from joining the server graveyard for months or years to come.<br><br>I hope the next news article is one titled "The SMG-SMP Lives On!", instead of "The SMG-SMP Has Shutdown". Thank you for your support so far, and I hope it will continue over the course of this next (and hopefully not last) month.</p>
