        <h1>SMG-SMP Planned For Renewal In 2024</h1>
        <p>In a post on Discord, SomeMineGame confirmed some allegations about working on another server. Suspicion came after the Discord bot was turning on and off, the Bot's testing server was having SomeMineGame running commands in it, and some server start, join, and stopped messages were caught before deletion. These flags led for people to start questioning SomeMineGame for more info.<br><br>In a post on Discord, SomeMineGame confirmed this, stating "I'm making a new server called the SMG-SMP... and working on finishing and upgrading the wiki". He also mentioned that he was working on optimizing the Discord bot and its database. SomeMineGame gave a release estimate of late January or sometime in February.<br><br>There is some bad news that comes with this announcement however. SomeMineGame released a full in-depth spreadsheet of his operation's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y2FXi6wDGKK0al6M0pRVeHMYEKAh8omL-QHy9xpbkrs/edit#gid=0">expenses</a>. He announced that unless server members start assisting him on his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=50582964">Patreon page</a>, he "will not pay for any additional features, and if the current server and/or proposed ones fail or die, I [SomeMineGame] will not replace them", and that he'd go back to using Aternos to host things. This is due to him receiving no compensation for any part of the server development. Some of the things he listed were coding the bots and website, along with managing everything, upgrading/updating things, and "much more all on my [SomeMineGame's] own".</p>
