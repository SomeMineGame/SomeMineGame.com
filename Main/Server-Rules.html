This will start with the Prosecutor, then Defendant, then Witness(es), then Prosecutor counter claim, then Defendant counter claim. A jury will then say whether the Defendant is guilty and the charge associated with the decision. A player cannot serve on the jury if they have bias towards a side. If a jury is not available, the judge will take this role. Once the jury or judge says their decision, it will be final. These cannot be over punishing.
