            <h1>What are Subs?</h1>
            <h2>Subs are a monthly subscription to the Premium Bot's features and can be purchased through <a href="https://patreon.com/user?u=50582964">Patreon</a>. There are three different tiers of access, each gaining more features that stack on top of the previous. The list of features and commands will be shown below.</h2>
            <h1>What do the patrons help cover?</h1>
            <h2>Patrons help cover the cost of the Wiki as well as the IPs for Java, Bedrock, and <a href="http://map.someminegame.com/#">Dynmap.</a> If we don't have any patrons, we'll have to resort to ads on the wiki. A list of our amazing patrons helping us stay ad-free can be found <a href="./Extra/Patrons.html">here</a>!</h2>
            <h1>What are the benefits to becoming a patron of the SMG-SMP?</h1>
            <h2>As mentioned above, you'll get special Premium bot access depending on your tier. The higher the tier, the more features you'll get! Note, these features are Discord only - and they will never interfere or interact with the Minecraft server to keep it free from the influence of <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pay-to-win.htm">P2W</a>. You'll also get your Discord username displayed separately from everyone else with no or different tiers with a tier specific shade of green, and on the Wiki page of all our patrons! (For Discord to work, you'll have to link your patreon and Discord accounts together)</h2>
