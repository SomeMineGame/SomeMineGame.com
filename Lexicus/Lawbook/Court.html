                <h1>Reporting a Player</h1>
                <h2>Using the reportIncident command on Discord, a plater can initiate an investigation up to 3 days in length against another player with the details of the alleged problem. A court member will review the details of the case to see if the problem is covered by a national or international law. If they determine it is, they will find the player in question and get their side. They will be held in on of the court's holding areas, which is comparable to an apartment.</h2>

                <h1>Holding a Player</h1>
                <h2>Once it has been determined the player will be held, they can hire someone to represent them or self-represent. They will be given the Defendant role on Discord. The Prosecutor will be given the same representation options and given the Prosecutor role on Discord. The prosecution will have 24 hours after being notified to submit their initial evidence. The Defendant will be given 36 hours. If the prosecution fails to deliver their evidence, the case will be dropped and the player freed. After this, both teams will have 24 hours to review the other's evidence and submit any new evidence. The initial trial will start at the first date the defendant, prosecution, and Judge can first meet. The judge will be the Server Owner unless they are involved, have witnessed the case, or passed it on to another trustworthy player.</h2>

                <h1>Initial Trial</h1>
                <h2>At the inital trial, both parties will be given the chance to display their evidence and give their statements. If the judge decides the prosecution doesn't have a viable statement or proper evidence, they can drop the case. If the case is approved, each side will have a further 24 hours to prepare the rest of their case. The official trial will start the next time everyone is able to. This is also when the defending team will give their plea.</h2>

                <h2>The court session will start with the Judge introducing Prosecution and Defense teams, the reason for the session, and the related articles/laws. The Prosecution will then give their opening statement, followed by the Defense. The Prosecution can then present their evidence, and the Defense will have the opportunity to counter it. The Defense will then present their evidence and the Prosecution will have the opportunity to counter it. The Prosecution will call up a witness, if one is present, to ask questions. The Defense can then ask their questions. This will happen until all witnesses are exhausted and the same procedure will happen with the Defense and their witnesses. A 15 minute break will be called. Afterwards, the Prosecution will give their closing statement, followed by the Defense. If the punishment involves prison, or the player is unable to pay for all damages and fines, they will be transferred to prison.</h2>

Will result in a 15% punishment increase if found Guilty.<br>2. Guilty - The player accepts all wrongdoing. Will result in a 30% punishment decrease, but sentencing is immediate without Court.<br>3. No Contest - The player doesn't accept any guilt but believes the Prosecution will win. Will result in neutral punishment if found guilty, and in $5,000 court fees if found not guilty.</h2>

                <h1>Tips for a Good Prosecution</h1>
                <h2>1. To ensure your statement is viable, review the national and international laws. Make sure what you're charging them with is actually covered.<br>2. Make sure the player in question is easily identified in at least 1 piece of evidence, or else your case is likely to be dropped for improper evidence.<br>3. Be sure to analyze the Defense's evidence prior to the trial so you know how to counter it during court, or submit any counter evidence in the new time allotment.</h2>
