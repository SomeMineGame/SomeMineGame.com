                <h1>Forming a Nation</h1>
                <h2>To form a nation, a player must first gain 4 others to join them, for a total of 5 players including themselves. They then must design a prison, a court, a law system, player intake system, determine their tax rates, and make their proposal. They must also come up with $50,000 for each chunk of land to pay the International Agency. The land area can’t have diagonals or curves as Minecraft can’t calculate it.</h2>

                <h1>War Procedures</h1>
                <h2>If a nation is neutral, you may not include them as outlined in IL.6.3. A nation or ally will no longer be involved in a war once they surrender, and an agreement will be made with all other nations and allied forces they were in a conflict with. The war ends when one of the final two nations or allies surrender and make an agreement.<br><br>What you can do: (1). You can kill any player on an opposing side. (2). You can steal any of an opposing side’s items, though they may need to be returned if determined in an agreement. (3). You can take control of an opposing side’s structures effectively cutting them off from their resources. (4). Kill an opposing side’s pets or animals.<br><br>What you can’t do: (1). Intentionally destroy an opposing side’s structures if determined you’re going to lose. (2). Destroy or damage any structures registered as historical.</h2>

                <h1>Committing a Crime in Another Nation</h1>
                <h2>All players are held responsible for following international laws and procedures. When traveling in or through another nation, it is a player's job to make sure they understand what that nation's laws are as well. If a player breaks a nation's laws while on their soil, they will be held responsible and prosecuted to that nation's standards. The player will also serve in that nation's prison unless they broke an international law, in which case, they will serve out their sentence in the international prison first, before being transferred to the nation's prison. If chosen, their home nation can remove their membership for breaking rules.</h2>

                <h1>Prisons</h1>
                <h2>All nations' main prison must have two entrances. The main entrance for prisoner booking/release and a visitor entrance. If a nation has prisoners they do not want to have visitor access, they can specify in their prison plan what tier these players are. The international prison will have the solitary confinement prisoners without visitor privilege. Prisoners must be fed at least 7 hunger bars a day. All prisoners besides those in a form of isolation must be given at least some time outside. All prisons are to have some form of activities for prisoners to do, so they aren't just stuck in a state of either boredom or feeling temp banned. Prisoners are still to be treated as regular players, as their punishment is the prison, not the treatment from prison staff.</h2>

                <h1>Amendments</h1>
                <h2>Any player, regardless of their status in a prison, will be able to vote on changing or adding rules to the server. A proposition can be made and discussed, and submitted with the amendPoll command on Discord. Everyone except the server owner may vote on this poll. If the poll is positive by at least 75% after 3 days, it will be passed on to the server owner to accept or deny it. They should only deny a proposal if they think it is harmful to the server. If the result is in favor of change, it will need to be reviewed and resubmitted. If the owner denies or the result is in favor of denial, the proposal will be dead and can’t be retried for 100 real days.</h2>
