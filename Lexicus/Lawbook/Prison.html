                <h2>Once a player is transferred to a prison, they are checked in through the main entrance. Here, they will be given their outfit and have their backpack and /echest permissions removed. They will also be given a brief overview of what to expect over the next little while. Next they will be taken to the inventory check area.</h2>

                <h1>Inventory Check</h1>
                <h2>In the first part of the inventory check will be a basic room with a double chest and two shulkers, a bed, and an armor stand. The prisoner will need to put their prison uniform on the armor stand and all items in their inventory into the chest. They must then set their spawn. A guard will then lead them to the kill room, which will be a lever wired to a dispenser filled with harming potions. If needed due to prisoner prevention (totems, potions, food, ect), an alternative or pvp method is permitted. Any items on the player at the time of their death is donated to the prison. All items the player left in the spawn room will be collected just before the prisoner is killed and put into a prisoner storage area and returned upon release. Finally they will be taken to the holding cells until a cell is assigned.</h2>
